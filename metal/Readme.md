### Filename shaders.metal

The filename shaders.metal is used for a Metal Shading Language (MSL) source code file, which is the standard format for writing shaders in Apple's Metal framework.

 The .metal file extension is required for Xcode and the GPU frame debugger to recognize the source files during development, debugging, and profiling.

 This file typically contains shader functions written in MSL, such as vertex and fragment functions, which are essential for rendering graphics.

 For instance, a shaders.metal file might include a vertex function to transform geometry and a fragment function to determine pixel color.

 The file can be compiled into an intermediate representation (.ir) using the xcrun -sdk macosx metal -c shaders.metal -o shaders.ir command, which can then be disassembled into a human-readable LLVM assembly format using llvm-dis.

 This compiled code is later packaged into a .metallib file, which is included in the application bundle and contains the compiled shader code and metadata.
