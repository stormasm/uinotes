### What is winit

Winit is a popular Rust library for handling window creation and input events. It serves as the foundation for many graphics and game development frameworks, making it an essential tool for creating cross-platform applications. In this article, weâ€™ll explore how to use Winit to create a basic window and handle events like user input.
