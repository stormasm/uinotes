### Is winit the only window bevy uses to draw windows on the screen for mac os

Yes, Bevy primarily uses Winit for window creation and management on macOS (and other desktop platforms).

Here's a breakdown:

Bevy's windowing system is designed to be platform-agnostic, with bevy_window providing the core interface.

For platform-specific implementations, like creating and managing windows on macOS, Bevy relies on libraries like bevy_winit, which leverages the winit crate.

Winit handles the interaction with the macOS operating system to create the window, manage its lifecycle, and receive events like resizing, input, etc.

### Can Bevy use other windowing libraries?

While Winit is the default and standard approach for Bevy, it's a modular engine. Therefore, it's possible to replace WinitPlugin with custom windowing code. This might involve:

Running Bevy in a separate thread and providing it with a graphics surface handle (like wgpu::Surface) obtained from another windowing solution.

Creating a custom plugin that integrates Bevy with another windowing library like Tao.

However, for most Bevy users, Winit will be the primary and recommended method for handling windows on macOS.
